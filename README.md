## 1.  Overview

This is a set of configuration and setup files to run a CKAN site.

The CKAN images used are from the official CKAN [ckan-docker](https://github.com/ckan/ckan-docker-base) repo

The non-CKAN images are as follows:

* DataPusher: CKAN's [pre-configured DataPusher image](https://github.com/ckan/ckan-base/tree/main/datapusher).
* PostgreSQL: Official PostgreSQL image. Database files are stored in a named volume.
* Solr: CKAN's [pre-configured Solr image](https://github.com/ckan/ckan-solr). Index data is stored in a named volume.
* Redis: standard Redis image
* NGINX: latest stable nginx image that includes SSL and Non-SSL endpoints

The site is configured using environment variables that you can set in the `.env` file.

## 2.  Installing Docker

Install Docker by following the following instructions: [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

To verify a successful Docker installation, run `docker run hello-world` and `docker version`. These commands should output 
versions for client and server.

## 3.  docker compose *vs* docker-compose

All Docker Compose commands in this README will use the V2 version of Compose ie: `docker compose`. The older version (V1) 
used the `docker-compose` command. Please see [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-v2/) for
more information.

## 4.  Install (build and run) CKAN plus dependencies

#### Base mode

Use this if you are a maintainer and will not be making code changes to CKAN or to CKAN extensions

Copy the included `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`. Modify it depending on your own needs.

Please note that when accessing CKAN directly (via a browser) ie: not going through NGINX you will need to make sure you have "ckan" set up
to be an alias to localhost in the local hosts file. Either that or you will need to change the `.env` entry for CKAN_SITE_URL

Using the default values on the `.env.example` file will get you a working CKAN instance. There is a sysadmin user created by default with the values defined in `CKAN_SYSADMIN_NAME` and `CKAN_SYSADMIN_PASSWORD`(`ckan_admin` and `test1234` by default). This should be obviously changed before running this setup as a public CKAN instance.

To build the images:

	docker compose build

To start the containers:

	docker compose up

This will start up the containers in the current window. By default the containers will log direct to this window with each container
using a different colour. You could also use the -d "detach mode" option ie: `docker compose up -d` if you wished to use the current 
window for something else.

At the end of the container start sequence there should be 6 containers running

After this step, CKAN should be running at `CKAN_SITE_URL`.


#### Development mode

Use this mode if you are making code changes to CKAN and either creating new extensions or making code changes to existing extensions. This mode also uses the `.env` file for config options.

To develop local extensions use the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file:

To build the images:

	docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build

To start the containers:

	docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

See [CKAN Images](#ckan-images) for more details of what happens when using development mode.


##### Create an extension

You can use the ckan [extension](https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/extensions/tutorial.html#creating-a-new-extension) instructions to create a CKAN extension, only executing the command inside the CKAN container and setting the mounted `src/` folder as output:

    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec ckan-dev /bin/sh -c "ckan -c /srv/app/ckan.ini generate extension --output-dir /srv/app/src_extensions"

![Screenshot 2023-02-22 at 1 45 55 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54408245/220623568-b4e074c7-6d07-4d27-ae29-35ce70961463.png)


The new extension files and directories are created in the `/srv/app/src_extensions/` folder in the running container. They will also exist in the local src/ directory as local `/src` directory is mounted as `/srv/app/src_extensions/` on the ckan container. You might need to change the owner of its folder to have the appropiate permissions.

##### Running HTTPS on development mode

Sometimes is useful to run your local development instance under HTTPS, for instance if you are using authentication extensions like [ckanext-saml2auth](https://github.com/keitaroinc/ckanext-saml2auth). To enable it, set the following in your `.env` file:

```
  USE_HTTPS_FOR_DEV=true
```

and update the site URL setting:

```
  CKAN_SITE_URL=https://${CKAN_DOMAIN}:${CKAN_PORT_HOST}
```

After recreating the `ckan-dev` container, you should be able to access CKAN at https://localhost:5000


## 5. CKAN images
![ckan images](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54408245/207079416-a01235af-2dea-4425-b6fd-f8c3687dd993.png)



The Docker image config files used to build your CKAN project are located in the `ckan/` folder. There are two Docker files:

* `Dockerfile`: this is based on `ckan/ckan-base:<version>`, a base image located in the DockerHub repository, that has CKAN installed along with all its dependencies, properly configured and running on [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (production setup)
* `Dockerfile.dev`:  this is based on `ckan/ckan-base:<version>-dev` also located located in the DockerHub repository, and extends `ckan/ckan-base:<version>` to include:

  * Any extension cloned on the `src` folder will be installed in the CKAN container when booting up Docker Compose (`docker compose up`). This includes installing any requirements listed in a `requirements.txt` (or `pip-requirements.txt`) file and running `python setup.py develop`.
  * CKAN is started running this: `/usr/bin/ckan -c /srv/app/ckan.ini run -H 0.0.0.0`.
  * Make sure to add the local plugins to the `CKAN__PLUGINS` env var in the `.env` file.

* Any custom changes to the scripts run during container start up can be made to scripts in the `setup/` directory. For instance if you wanted to change the port on which CKAN runs you would need to make changes to the Docker Compose yaml file, and the `start_ckan.sh.override` file. Then you would need to add the following line to the Dockerfile ie: `COPY setup/start_ckan.sh.override ${APP_DIR}/start_ckan.sh`. The `start_ckan.sh` file in the locally built image would override the `start_ckan.sh` file included in the base image

## 6. Extending the base images

You can modify the docker files to build your own customized image tailored to your project, installing any extensions and extra requirements needed. For example here is where you would update to use a different CKAN base image ie: `ckan/ckan-base:<new version>`

To perform extra initialization steps you can add scripts to your custom images and copy them to the `/docker-entrypoint.d` folder (The folder should be created for you when you build the image). Any `*.sh` and `*.py` file in that folder will be executed just after the main initialization script ([`prerun.py`](https://github.com/ckan/ckan-docker-base/blob/main/ckan-2.9/base/setup/prerun.py)) is executed and just before the web server and supervisor processes are started.

For instance, consider the following custom image:

```
ckan
├── docker-entrypoint.d
│   └── setup_validation.sh
├── Dockerfile
└── Dockerfile.dev

```

We want to install an extension like [ckanext-validation](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/ckanext-validation) that needs to create database tables on startup time. We create a `setup_validation.sh` script in a `docker-entrypoint.d` folder with the necessary commands:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create DB tables if not there
ckan -c /srv/app/ckan.ini validation init-db 
```

And then in our `Dockerfile.dev` file we install the extension and copy the initialization scripts:

```Dockerfile
FROM ckan/ckan-base:2.10.1-dev

RUN pip install -e git+https://github.com/frictionlessdata/ckanext-validation.git#egg=ckanext-validation && \
    pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frictionlessdata/ckanext-validation/master/requirements.txt

COPY docker-entrypoint.d/* /docker-entrypoint.d/
```

> Note: There are a number of extension examples commented out in the Dockerfile.dev file

## 7. Applying patches

When building your project specific CKAN images (the ones defined in the `ckan/` folder), you can apply patches 
to CKAN core or any of the built extensions. To do so create a folder inside `ckan/patches` with the name of the
package to patch (ie `ckan` or `ckanext-??`). Inside you can place patch files that will be applied when building
the images. The patches will be applied in alphabetical order, so you can prefix them sequentially if necessary.

For instance, check the following example image folder:

```
ckan
├── patches
│   ├── ckan
│   │   ├── 01_datasets_per_page.patch
│   │   ├── 02_groups_per_page.patch
│   │   ├── 03_or_filters.patch
│   └── ckanext-harvest
│       └── 01_resubmit_objects.patch
├── setup
├── Dockerfile
└── Dockerfile.dev

```

## 8. pdb

Add these lines to the `ckan-dev` service in the docker-compose.dev.yml file

![pdb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54408245/179964232-9e98a451-5fe9-4842-ba9b-751bcc627730.png)

Debug with pdb (example) - Interact with `docker attach $(docker container ls -qf name=ckan)`

command: `python -m pdb /usr/lib/ckan/venv/bin/ckan --config /srv/app/ckan.ini run --host 0.0.0.0 --passthrough-errors`

## 9. Datastore and datapusher

The Datastore database and user is created as part of the entrypoint scripts for the db container. There is also a Datapusher container 
running the latest version of Datapusher.

## 10. NGINX

The base Docker Compose configuration uses NGINX as the front-end (ie: reverse proxy) and
SSL terminator. It accepts HTTPS connections on ports 80 and 443 (port 80 gets redirected to 443).
A "self-signed" SSL certificate is generated when NGINX starts, unless you provide your own
certificate and key (see below). This should obviously not be used for production.

NGINX can automatically obtain a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/)
SSL certificate and renew it periodically, if you configure the  value `CKAN_AUTO_CERT` in
the `.env` file. The hostname and the email address to be used in the certificate request
must be defined in the `.env` file.

> Note: If you are not using a self-signed certificate, you must define the domain name on
> which CKAN will be published in the variable `CKAN_DOMAIN` in the `.env` file. If you supply
> your own certificate, the configured domain name must match the domain name in the certificate.

> Note: Even when you set `CKAN_AUTO_CERT` to `true` to use a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate,
> NGINX will still use a self-signed certificate and will only do dry runs for requesting a 
> certificate to avoid the [rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/) of
> Let's Encrypt. Once you are satisfied that everything is running as expected, you can comment
> out the setting `LETSENCRYPT_DRYRUN` in the `.env` file.

If you want to use your own SSL certificate with CKAN, you must supply the files
`fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem`, respectively. Consider the following folder structure:

```
nginx
├── certificate
│   ├── my_cert.pem
│   └── my_key.pem
└── Dockerfile
```

Then modify the NGINX Dockerfile to use these files:

```
COPY certificate/my_cert.pem /usr/share/nginx/certificates/fullchain.pem
COPY certificate/my_key.pem /usr/share/nginx/certificates/privkey.pem
```

> Note: In case you remove the CKAN containers, retain the volume `ssl_cert`,
> which contains the SSL certificate. This will avoid requesting a new one for the same domain,
> in case you redeploy CKAN (prevents exceeding Let's Encrypt rate limit).

## 11. envvars

The ckanext-envvars extension is used in the CKAN Docker base repo to build the base images.
This extension checks for environmental variables conforming to an expected format and updates the corresponding CKAN config settings with its value.

For the extension to correctly identify which env var keys map to the format used for the config object, env var keys should be formatted in the following way:

  All uppercase  
  Replace periods ('.') with two underscores ('__')  
  Keys must begin with 'CKAN' or 'CKANEXT', if they do not you can prepend them with '`CKAN___`' 

For example:

  * `CKAN__PLUGINS="envvars image_view text_view recline_view datastore datapusher"`
  * `CKAN__DATAPUSHER__CALLBACK_URL_BASE=http://ckan:5000`
  * `CKAN___BEAKER__SESSION__SECRET=CHANGE_ME`

These parameters can be added to the `.env` file 

For more information please see [ckanext-envvars](https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-envvars)

## 12. Connecting directly

For convenience, in development deployments you can connect directly to the CKAN container
at http://localhost:5000. In non-development environments you can use https://localhost:443.
The hostname is defined in variable `CKAN_DOMAIN`, while the port is defined in 
variable `CKAN_PORT_HOST` in the `.env` file.

## 13. Manage new users

1. Create a new user from the Docker host, for example to create a new user called 'admin'

   `docker exec -it <container-id> ckan -c ckan.ini user add admin email=admin@localhost`

   To delete the 'admin' user

   `docker exec -it <container-id> ckan -c ckan.ini user remove admin`

2. Create a new user from within the ckan container. You will need to get a session on the running container

   `ckan -c ckan.ini user add admin email=admin@localhost`

   To delete the 'admin' user

   `ckan -c ckan.ini user remove admin`

## 14. Changing the base image

The base image used in the CKAN Dockerfile and Dockerfile.dev can be changed so a different DockerHub image is used eg: ckan/ckan-base:2.9.9
could be used instead of ckan/ckan-base:2.10.1
